      Unit 1 is already drafted in `unit1.qmd`. Remaining edits, if any, should keep the
      narrative synchronized with the transcripts listed for each lecture task.

    notes: |
      Draft a chapter that mirrors the lecture sequence on simple random sampling.
      Each task draws on the listed transcripts and should produce a new Quarto
      chapter (e.g., `unit2.qmd`).
